      " How is bodyweight strength training different for adults compared to children? Good question. First seminar I ever did for adults. I'm a national team coach. And what I learned is it really skewed my expectations of what was normal because that was my world. That was who I was surrounded by. They weren't exceptional. They just were. These are the expectations. I ask them to do things and they can perform at this level. So I run an event for adults, first GB seminar on their schedule for the day. And I'm going to take them through just a gentle warmup, nothing hard, nothing demanding. I've got 15 minutes on the schedule, 10 minutes, 15 if we're dragging. I can't get them to focus. They're not paying attention, whatever. And it took an hour and a half for a nothing warmup. They were wrecked from it. They were wrecked. They were exhausted, sweat everywhere, body strewn all over the floor. I remember turning to my staff and I go, you know, what do I do now? You know, they failed warmup. You know, we have to adjust all the rest of the three days on the fly because their level of prep and capacity was so much lower than I expected. What was the warmup out of interest? What did that involve? Nothing. There was no plyometrics in it. There was no advanced mobility. There would have been basic positions, front, left, middle, pancake, shoulder extension, which we know now they didn't have. You know, my guys, we would do our wrist prep series. A lot of the things we would do weren't considered strength. They were considered warmup. So an example would be, we're going to do the wrist series with all the, are my wrist pushup series that everyone now thinks, you know, we've, we've known about this stuff since the beginning of time, but it wasn't, it was my series, but you know, it's maybe 50 different pushups, different variations. It should take my athletes a couple of minutes to get through it. You know, just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, letting them know if you can't handle 50 pushups, even though these are difficult, you know, wrist pushups, if you can't handle that, that an iron cross is out of the question. You know, or, you know, part of, part of their warmup was, um, on a seven meter rope, three rope climbs in a row, climb the rope, three laps in a row without stopping in the back of the line. We run through it three times. That was warmup for us. That's just checking the pressure in the tires. How's the oil today? How do I feel? Okay. After, after that kind, that kind of level work, now we can actually go and start training. So out of, out of all my friends who are, you know, Olympians and world championship coaches and all that stuff, I w I was unusual that they just wanted to work with the best. That's all they wanted to do. And I'd get fussed at all the time. For working with people who weren't just my national team athletes. Unless the Chinese more quiet, my friends who were rushed, we're just like, what are you doing? What are you doing? And I said, well, you know, I like to work with people who give me everything to have. They may not be very good, but I really enjoy that. I'd much, I've, I've thrown Olympians out of the gym because they weren't working hard enough. You know, and people around me were, you know, they're freaking out. They're like, you know, nationals is next week. I don't give a damn. I don't give a damn. This lack of effort is unacceptable. I'm not doing it. Not doing it. But you know, they would have said, well, absolutely. We'll do it. Blah, blah, blah, blah. No. So I have this young man named Tim who's overweight and he comes to a GB seminar, which is sculpted bodies everywhere, muscle everywhere, studs, male, female. They're very athletic. And here's Tim pudgy, overweight, but he's just busting his butt. He's just busting his butt. And I loved it. I just loved it. And, um, I hadn't talked to everyone in the story was he had lost a hundred pounds, but he couldn't train, trained. So just our mobility work had been his workout. That was all he could do. And he used that to lose a hundred pounds. I still, to this day, that's been, I don't know, 15 years ago, 12 years ago. I just, I just love the, the dedication. Cause think how hard it is for someone who's in normal shape to do my material. And here's this guy that, you know, putting on his socks in the morning, wears him out and he's consistent and he's working hard. And it's like, you know, guys, this is, this is what I love right here. Cause we've been for, I've been fortunate enough to, um, I'm sure you have to, I've worked with a lot of people, a lot of different spheres. So, you know, you know, we've had some billionaires, we worked with some bestselling authors, some, you know, the normal, you know, special operations stuff, what they have in common is they all do their best. Whatever, whatever it is, their best ad. It's like, it's like a common language. You know, I'm sure, I'm sure there's guys out there who don't operate that way, but I haven't met them, you know, in those spheres. And so when I see someone who they'll give me their best at me, the quality may not be good, but they're giving me everything. Okay. And this one area, since they've learned that now we can, we can push that out into other areas. And that's refreshing for people to hear that are listening to this because they'll see a champion world-class Olympian in gymnastics, and they see what's required to achieve that level. It's nice to know that if we embody that work ethic, regardless of our point, we'll go on to achieve great things. And that's a universal mindset of people that do make progress. You might. So, Alan, so my last athlete almost made the Olympic team for Tokyo. He was alternate. So we were just a bit short. For those who haven't interacted with world-class athletes, they're not stronger. They're not faster. They're not just more coordinated in a way that you kind of imagine or can grasp. They're so much further ahead physically that they're almost from a different planet. You know, that there's that very top, top group. People who have tried to roll on the mat with Olympic judo players. You know, it's just like they tried to wrestle with a tornado. And one guy, you know, he didn't back off enough and he came out with a broken collarbone. And the other guy was trying to be easy, but the one guy had bit off more than he could chew, right? And he was on the mat with the wrong guy. And so even with that level of talent for Alan, it still took me 12 years and over 16,000 hours of training. As picky as I am and as demanding as I am, it took that, even though he had this tremendous level of talent, right? It still took me thousands and thousands of hours to get him to where I needed him to be. I also had other athletes that worked just as hard as Alan, weren't on national team and didn't win nationals and didn't make a world team and didn't make an Olympic team, but they did, they did a decade of training with me. They kind of think, well, you know, that 10,000 hour rule, if I do everything I should do, I'm going to achieve world-class performance. And the answer is maybe, you know, if, if the potential, so the question is, is it nurture or it's nature? And it's both. I, I can't develop what's not there, but we can try to maximize what you have. That may be a lot more than you expect, right? Might be a lot more than you expect. It may be disappointing, but there's nothing you can do about it either way. This is the hand of cards you've been dealt in life. You know, you don't get to fold and say, well, I'll take another hand, right? This, this is what you got. Do the best with it. And if you're one of the fortunate few, you'll crank. But, you know, if not, you know, I ran my entire gym on best effort, you know, that, that was everything for us, you know? So who gave me best effort, who was living up to their potential? Uh, they were recognized for that. And that guys, even if Alan won nationals, but it wasn't everything that he could have done, right? And if he, so we would, I would line, the reason it matters, I would line all my athletes up according to how they had performed at their competitions, but the scores didn't matter. And the placings didn't matter. It was all about what were you personally capable of best effort on that routine plus a stuck landing, right? And so I'd get little guys who barely could walk in a straight line and I, I'd put them in the front of the line, right? The real, the real world and the listeners are going to know, you know, your, your boss doesn't care if you did your best, if you failed and the company lost a lot of money. He, he doesn't care. He can't afford to care, right? Cause he has expenses, right? He's got overhead. There's paychecks to go out. He needs you to be a stud and he needs you to win. He needs you to produce, but in the gym and I let my athletes know this, you know, I can artificially control this for right now, for now you giving me your best is good enough while letting them know outside in the real world, not only are they not going to care, they can't afford to care. And so, you know, right now we're going to, we're going to train you. So one of my athletes who couldn't eat physically, couldn't hang with Alan, but, uh, some dorky little kid when he was little, this huge pair of ears took, I took three years teaching him a cartwheel. Wow. I used to tease Ian all the time. I was like, dude, I could have taught a little kid in a wheelchair, a cartwheel faster than you've learned this. This is, this is kind of silly, dude, but he just kept the, just give me a big goofy smile and he jumped back in, but he just would never stop. And then every year I would think he was maxed out and he would still improve right when I thought he couldn't do anymore. Now he'd have to work twice as hard as everyone else. And he's, he's a pilot in the air force. He's a major, right? A little guy who wasn't a good student, wasn't a good athlete initially, right? But just kept his nose to the grindstone. And so, you know, will you, will you see someone without massive talent on an Olympic team? You won't, but that's five guys out of 330 million. Given the genetics, uh, elite to start with, and it's coupled with that mindset of pushing yourself hard consistently. In addition to that, your method focuses heavily on physical preparation. Why is this the case? A hundred percent. It was my experiences in training. So I remember national team coach, Olympic training center, sports scientists in and out constantly pressure plates, you know, all the, all the sensors, athletes wired up all the time. And, um, we, we found out that even something as simple as a round off back handspring backflip, you know, that, that punch in the backflip was 14 times body weight. Think about the structural adaptation. So tendons and ligaments strengthen through extremely high loads for a micro fraction of a second. That's, that's how they're conditioned. You know, you for, for athletic purposes, I can get stronger through isometric pause, controlling and eccentric, but that's, that's really a fairly low ceiling for that. But, and notice, notice it's starting to come around now where they're, they're talk. The buzzword right now is the plyometrics, right? We're going to do plyometrics, but it's really, they're all, they're all just doing low end plyometrics. They're doing jumps. You know, there's very little rebound work. There's very little straight leg work. There's zero lock arm work. Years ago, I, uh, was invited by, uh, Paula Quinn to, uh, go to their headquarters in Rhode Island. I believe it was to do a dynamic strength seminar. So basically upper body plyometrics, big, strong guys, monsters everywhere, dwarfed me. And so we go and I spend the whole day doing a physical prep. Now just get them ready. Don't want anyone to get hurt. Act of mobility, you know, how are they? And by then it was, uh, time to just, um, do what I would do with a five-year-old. And we start them with, uh, imagine a, a pushup position with locked elbows and just bouncing up and down in place. No, no bending the knees, no bending the elbows, no sagging the stomach, sheer repulsion strength, rebound strength through the shoulder girdle. None of them, they, they were glued to the floor, you know, and I hadn't trained in forever. And I was like, you know, guys, this is, this is, I brought athletes with me and they're, well, you know, these guys are athletes and guys, I'm a fossil. And I got down and, you know, and showed them to this, this is, this is easy stuff guys, but they had never been exposed to it. And that's, that's kind of where the athleticism comes from. What are the standards you're looking for from a physical prep perspective, like numbers and stuff fucked up? Well, back in the day, Greg Glassman, I was the gymnastics guy for Crossed Head. They wanted people to go into kipping pull-ups, but you know, I said, you know, Greg, you're, the kipping pull-ups are actually kind of the final step, if you will. And you, you guys are doing it first, doing it first. And he's, well, you know, they get excited, you know, and they've never done a pull-up and I can come in and have them start with their chin over the bar and fall down and bounce back up and they're excited. I was like, yeah, okay, but I'm not strong enough to do one. And I don't think you realize you're exposing them to multiple times body weight at the bottom of that bounce. And they weren't strong enough to do one times body weight. So now you're going two times body weight and they're not just going to hit the bottom and come straight up. They're going to hit the bottom and go through a degree of flexion that they're not flexible enough to do. So you've over, you've, you've loaded them too hard. You've extended, you've exceeded their range of motion. They didn't break right now, but they're going to. And then I think usually what happened is when two or after two or three months of doing CrossFit, we started seeing a lot of slap tears in adult population should never happen. What the hell are they getting slap tears for? And oh my gosh, they were, you know, it's their, I get it. The CrossFitters, it's their baby, you know, and telling them that this particular step isn't, is not a good idea is like telling a mama that her child's ugly. You know, they, they, they take it personally or they, they just, you know, jumped on the bandwagon to attack me in mass. But interestingly now over the years, that's morphed to, you need to be able to do five pull-ups before you go into kipping work. But when I told them that, oh my gosh, they, they were, they were not having anything. They did not want to hear it. So, you know, some pull-ups, some dips. I, in the initial days, you know, I would have said, you know, our rope climbs, but I realized that for your, for your general market, that was excessive. So, you know, your five pull-ups, we started with the, the body weight row variations. Just wanted to take time, build the grip strength. So what, what we found with adults is they're not very active except for their workout compared to someone who is young, who's, you're running around all day. You're riding your bike, you're running here, you're going to your friend's house, you're walking to school, you're, you're busy and moving all day. And then you, you hit, you know, eighth grade, ninth grade, and you start doing athletic training at school. And everyone thinks it was the athletic training alone that led to their increase in athleticism. And they kind of, they don't realize, because it's so ubiquitous, they move me all the time. They're not, it's like a fish in water. You know, you can't, you can't describe to a fish that you're surrounded by water 24 seven and fish goes, I have no idea what you're talking about. So they're in this tremendous everyday matrix of constant movement. And then we get adults and there's not that constant movement anymore. And their, their body now is trying, especially connective tissue is, is trying to survive on an hour a day. And it's just, it's, it's not meant to be the case. I had, you know, orthopedic surgeons who would come up, you know, everyone's knees, you know, are just gonna, they start breaking down at 35. Now it's just, it's just part of life. You know, your knees are going to go on this. Well, yes and no. I said, the reason they're breaking down at 35 is they graduate at college at 22 and they're fairly active and they're running around. And then, you know, mid twenties, late twenties, they're working. Okay. Well, that cuts into the time they can do stuff and they're getting tired and then they're going to meet someone. All right. So more free time is gone. They're going to hit 30. I said by the, by the time they're 35, except for being in the gym, they're not doing much and everything they're doing, there's no joint prep, right? There's, there's nothing. So the purpose, the purpose of joint prep is to build strength throughout range of motion. And that's, that's all mobility is, you know, flexibility is, is going to be that passive range of motion and mobility is going to be how much strength, what, what, what, what percentage of that range of motion can I demonstrate strength through and at what level of strength? That's, that's all mobility is in there. I see all kinds of silly, and foolish, you know, definitions of what mobility is and what it is in there. I actually don't know what the heck they're trying to do other than kind of stand out from the crowd. Now they're there, they're, they're just overly compensating or trying to make it overly complex, you know, to, I saw, I saw Daniel do this cool movement, but I can't say what Daniel said because I can't sell that as a product. So I'm going to take what Daniel said. I'm going to file off the serial numbers, give it a coat of paint. And this is new unicorn blood workout that made me the stud that fell down from the sky. She'd be like, well, and so there's, there's a lot of needless confusion. Yeah. It's frustrating. I wish we had a, there's enough complexity in exercise to begin with throwing in different terms for the same thing is really confusing. But at the end of the day, we're all fighting the same fight. It's just unfortunate that we get separated financially to, you know, stand out above other people, create a unique system. But I really don't like some aspects of the fitness industry compared to the clarity of national team. So national team, you, you were the best. If you won, you were national champion, you were the best. You didn't have to say you were the best. You didn't have to have a marketing campaign against all the competitors trying to show you were the best. Everyone knew. If your information is correct or best practice, it doesn't mean you win. That's right. One thing you've promoted, which is at a stark contrast and at odds to the fitness industry is this steady state training cycle where you keep the training load the same. We're talking the exact same sets, reps, hold times, progressions for an eight to 12 week phase. Why is this something that you recommend? I once, I once did it for a year. See, that would blow some people's minds because it's at odds with progressive overload with weights. Why is it different for body weight movements? I don't, I don't, I don't think it applies just to body weight. I was, I was just reading about a really famous Japanese power lifter, uh, Inaba Hideaki Inaba, 114 pounder. He had, uh, he didn't start lifting until he was 33. He won 27 world championship medals, competed all the way up to 60. His weights didn't drop, but he, he only did power lifting for two, three month blocks a year. All of this every year, he'd do a world championships in November. Then he would take December, January, and February completely off. He didn't do anything, said he didn't touch a barbell. Then he would start lifting in March and April, competed Japanese nationals in May. Of course, he's not a hundred percent. He's just getting back in. Then after that, he would do a, I keep lifting, but he would increase the reps and he would for three months slide into a bodybuilding protocol. And then he would do, um, through that would be through the summer, September, October, he's getting back in his power lifting worlds in November. So out of a year, he was only doing six months worth of power lifting and he had tremendous longevity. Young men, invulnerable, immortal, can't be hurt, bullets bounce off, impatient. I don't have time to take my time, but you have time to be hurt and not do anything. And so I tried, I tried, I had a long talk with them, you know, some teasing in that. And I said, you know, guys, what happens is people start training, especially the younger guys. Oh, and I would count that all the way through the twenties. Right. And I said two years, maybe three years before they're broken enough that they can't train anymore. And if they're extra tough and they'll push through the pain, maybe four, cause it's kind of that badge of honor, right? Push through the pain, be a man that I'm getting pictures sent all the time to me of people are proud because their hands are bloody. You know, they've ripped all their calluses off. There's a coach, I'm so tough. And they're laying, they're broken and they're laying in puddles of sweat. And I was like, you know, guys, there's not a world-class athlete anywhere that trains this way. I said, but look how tough I am. Look at my hands. And I said, well, yeah, that it does show that you worked really hard today, but what are you going to do tomorrow? So you can't train again for a week. And there's nothing you did today by destroying yourself. That's going to make up for you not being able to train for the next week. I said, you, you, you don't understand how the development works. I guess a simple way to describe it is you tried to write a novel in one day instead of a 365 page novel. You tried to write it in one day instead of just write a page today and write another page tomorrow. And I understand, you know, that in terms, in terms of it, it's not very thick and you feel like you didn't do anything, but after a year, 365, that's a lot of progress. And so that's, that's where the steady state cycle came from. Important even for the average person doing body weight strength training. And that's something that I attribute to my longevity. I started when I was 17. I'm still healthy and progressing at 31. And in my early days, I was fortunate in 2010 to come across gymnastics bodies by this coach, Christopher Sommer, who outlined the importance of how long it takes for tendons and connective tissue to adapt and how there's this mismatch when you feel like you're strong on a planche, a front lever, your body might be, you might be able to produce the force, do the movement, but there's a lag period with how your tendons adapt. It's measured in months as opposed to days and weeks. A hundred percent. Very good. You are one of the few who are, who was mature enough, right, to accept that this is reality. Okay. And behave accordingly. We're kind of, you know, a lot of us, when we're young, we have the tendency, I hear what you're saying, but that, that doesn't apply to me. I'm, I'm, you know, we're, we're guys, we're, we're testosterone boys, you know, I'm special. We get guys that they just want to do the strength or they're yoga people. And they just want to do the mobility, right. Or they're, they're athletes and they want to do their skill part. They're going to do the plyometric and centrifugal training, but they're lacking on strength or mobility. It could be both. And they don't realize how perfect the body is by itself before they start. And so they're not, they're not careful in having a comprehensive plan. So things get out of balance. I'm so glad you mentioned that piece about being well-rounded because that's something I'm preaching as hard as I possibly can at Fitness FAQs. I'm so glad you heard that. It's not just one domain. It's not just the body weight strength. It's not just the lifting weights. It's not just the flexibility, mobility, range of motion stuff. It's everything. It's how the components come together to make your body well-rounded. And it's almost as if people need a certain level of restraint. It's like reverse ego. All of us want to train hard, but it's the ability to be like, play the long game. I need to do these dinky exercises for my shoulder and isolate these different muscle groups so I can have a well-balanced body. I love how you said that. This is a hundred percent right. It's quite common for athletes to get very depressed after an Olympics, mainly because they weren't enjoying what they were doing. They thought Olympics was going to be this penultimate moment in their life. It was going to change their life. They were going to be somehow different walking out of the arena than walking into the arena. And it's not the case. If you're an idiot walking in, you're an idiot walking out. You're a nice person walking in. You are walking out. At the end of the day, it's still an athletic contest. Let's not get it twisted and make it more than it is. And so the ones that I've seen with kind of the healthiest approaches, enjoy the journey. Don't go from goal to goal to goal to goal because it's really unsatisfying. So what happens when you get the goal? Well, now what do you do? Well, I need a new goal instead of why do you train? I like training. Yeah. It seems the value from that steady state training is especially important for people playing sports that want to also condition with the gymnastic strength or, you know, people that are doing not even gymnastic strength. Yeah, like lifting weights or cardio. Pavel was on Joe Rogan, mentioned this by name, mentioned me by name, the program by name and steady state. And then they were talking about it as applied to weightlifting. And it's up on YouTube. People can look at it. Rogan, Pavel, go through the comments on the YouTube clip. And I was amazed how many weightlifters just doing basic, you know, squat, deadlift, bench, overhead, how strong they had gotten from doing steady state with their lifting. Some of them got really, really strong. And they were exactly like you said, you know, we're going to keep this a minimum of 10 to 12 weeks. Some of them started with just the bar and ended up doing some monstrous weights, some monstrous weights. I just find it fascinating. So at odds with progressive overload, you have to lift heavier, you've got to keep going harder and harder. But take it like this. If you do steady state stuff, you can always be perfecting your technique using a stricter tempo. Maybe you're being more explosive on the concentric. If you use the same weight, same progression, same everything, but you're manipulating that, the intent, your neurological system is going to improve, even if the load is similar. Notice we want everyone like, so I broke steady state into, in my mind, stages. So we have overload, load and under load. So the overload is I've, I have a load, I haven't, it could be an exercise, it could be a cross, it could be a handstand pushup, it could be a pushup, it doesn't matter. I have an exercise for a certain amount of reps that is really hard for me. We like that struggle. We like that struggle, kind of perks us up. We like the adrenaline. And then we have to stay in that until we go to load, which is the same. It just means the rate of perceived exertion, right, is less. So what used to be really, really hard is now easier for me. And that's where most people mess up is that once it gets easy, they immediately want to go back and increase load. Or what I want them to consider doing is you did overload, you've been in load. Now you need to stay with it until it's easy. You need to stay with it's easy so that it is just kind of like, I'm bored. So my, my athletes, they would, they would have could be Jefferson curl. We should talk about Jefferson curl, but you know, it could be something and they would keep coming up. Coach, can I increase? Can I increase? Can I increase? Can I increase? How long you been here? It's been 10 weeks. Almost. Almost. Oh my gosh. That'd come up again. You know, how long has it been? It's been 12 weeks. Okay. You know, go ahead. Because what, what we want is it's like, it's like an injury, right? If I have a sprained ankle, I'm going to be down for certain amount of weeks and then I'm going to be able to walk around. Okay. But I'm not recovered. My injury is just not, not so severe anymore that I can't walk. But if I try to jump, I'm going to get re-hurt. So walking, it feels like I'm okay. Structurally though, I'm not enough to be athletic. And then what they don't realize is, well, just because I can jump some, it's kind of like if this is a cliff, right? I can, I can come up to the edge as much as I want, as much as I want. I can dance on the edge and come back and I'm fine. But as soon as I go a little bit too far, I fall down the cliff and there's nothing I can do to get back over the cliff. Once I'm over, I'm over. And so that because a lot of our, our nervous system is functional rather than sensational, we can't feel the weakness, if you will. We can't feel how, how tenuous it is that, yeah, I'm performing, but I don't know that I don't, I don't understand that I'm really on the ragged edge, right? That I'm one little twist. And I, one Olympic lifter who was a national champion in the U.S., blew his knee out because he changed Olympic lifting shoes. People are going to go, well, that's crazy. He changed shoe. It's the same. Well, yeah, the shoe was like the final straw on the camel's back, but he, that injury had been there. It just needed that one last little push or Ivan Koff, world champion for Russia, tore his Achilles walking across the parking lot at the Atlanta Olympics in 96. Oh, geez, that's so often. Elite athletes in the shower, you know, they could do all these skills, coordination, agility on the field, but then they get in the shower, they're tired, they're fatigued, they hurt themselves. Same type of thing. Because the structural damage was there. It was there. It wasn't that taking a shower is dangerous, right? It was that I was broken and I didn't know it because there wasn't enough recovery. Like the Russian team, they take off the month of August. They just go away. The general population never has an off season, never takes a break. It's always pedal to the metal. Exactly. Exactly. The other advantage of that steady state training cycle is the mental discipline more than the physical attributes. It's coach. I want to progress. It's week six. No, you got to wait till week 12. And just having that discipline to stay consistent, stay patient, be in the process, because I'll say when I look at the average person who's doing progressive overload, it's not often progressive overload because they're chasing numbers and performance when they can't even do it. Oh, I'm going to go from eight pull-ups to 12. Your form's gone to trash. You've started going half range of motion. Or you're doing five sets instead of three sets, but your effort per set isn't what we want. I think maybe this will help them is because it sounds like what we're telling them is be really patient. Don't increase the load and you'll stay healthy, but it will also increase performance. A more straightforward example, deadlifts. And the protocol was two to three sets of two to three reps. I had an athlete, Heath, little guy, super strong, but little. We'll call him 112 pounds. And I start them off with 135 pounds. They get their two or three reps in with this 135, go do some more stuff, come back in another set. Boom. He did that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. And we don't increase the reps. Now it's early in his training cycle. So Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, there were days where he's like, you know, I'm tired. My back's tired today. Skip it. I don't care. Don't do it today. You know, we'll do it tomorrow at 135 for those reps and two sets for 12 weeks. And he's chomping at the bit, you know, can I do more? Can I do more? Buddy? Sure, dude. Go ahead. So he goes to put tens on it. Now he's, he's going to go, well, he wants to go from 135 to 155, which for someone who hasn't done steady state is a nice jump. I'm going to have a 20 pound jump. And percentage wise, that's a big percentage of 135. And I laugh at him. I said, I won't say what I said. So all the years of being in the military and national team coach language can be overly colorful at times. So I told, I told he don't waste my time with those, with those bleep, bleep, bleep, and tens, put 25s on. And he goes, there's no fricking way I can go from 135 to 185. I said, just shut up and put the 25s on the bar. So he puts the 25s on. He's looking at me, kind of the puppy dog eyes. I'll do it, but you're going to feel really bad when I explode and I die. And I said, yeah, whatever. Just, just put the damn weight on the bar. So he puts it on and he grabs the bar. And remember only 135, for three months, the 185 just flies off the floor and he does his reps and his eyes get sheared. And he's like, what the? And he goes to grab more weight. He's exciting. He's going for 225. I was like, slow your roll, dude, slow your roll. So, but the 185 was, was not a problem at all. And so if people will go through and look at those YouTube comments from that clip from Pavel on Rogan, you're going to see it replicated with other people. It goes against everything we've been taught in terms of linear progression because systemic fatigue, stabilization of the joints. Pavel expresses it a bit as that strength is a skill. Even after all these years, I'm not, I'm not quite willing to go that far, you know, but I, what we have learned, I can't quite explain it. We call it a bit of a black box, right? We drop stuff in and stuff comes out. We're really not quite sure what happens inside the black box. We just know if we do this protocol and we wait this long, we're going to get cool stuff out on the other side. So for example, in GST, bodyweight calisthenics, currently right now, we're getting a lot of people who are, they're doing some crazy weights on their weighted dips and on their, their weighted pull-ups. And it's impressive and it's awesome. But I'm also getting a lot of people writing me, you know, with, with injury, because they're, they're kind of going fast. Chill, you know, go, go a little slower, go slow now to go fast later. I think that advice is particularly relevant for people who are intermediate towards advanced that have been in the game for a few years. And it's so uplifting to know that you don't always have to be trying to progress on paper by doing the same thing. Your gains will be actualized later. If anything, you're just mitigating that injury risk, allowing some of your, the fatigue to settle your joints and tendons to feel better as well. Well, the beginners too weak really to hurt themselves. It's the intermediate and the advanced guys who are strong enough to hurt themselves. You know, they, they can really screw themselves up because the eccentrics, I really encourage people to play with them because the eccentric is a wonderful thing because connective tissue doesn't have its own capillary system. So that means if we're doing, well, if we're doing strength work of low rep, we're gradually starving that connective tissue, the ligaments and tendons, we're starving it because it's not getting enough blood flow. But if we start putting in eccentrics, so now instead of a fraction of a second under load during a rep, I've got 30 seconds of load, 30 seconds of circulation under strain kind of goes back to that steady state. If they'll just be work hard, give the body a chance to stabilize, work hard, give the body a chance to stabilize. And then that athletic ability lasts for a long time. I'm going to hurt some feelings here. It's that myofibral work, right? Rather than the sarcoplasmic work. So, you know, a bodybuilder, they're, they're, they're getting big. Notice a bodybuilder is puffy unless he's on diuretics or something, but because the nature of their training is always flushing the tissues, flushing the tissues. And they, they get a lot of, uh, fluid in between the cells, right? Plus the steroids they're taking are retaining fluid. And, uh, you'll see guys who they stopped taking steroids and three months later, it looks like they never lifted a day in their life. You know, they've been training all these years. They stopped training and they just pissed it all out. They had to work hard to get there, but there's no longevity because it's artificial. You'll hear the body goes, yeah, I got to go get a pump. I got to go get a pump. But an athlete, your structure has adapted. And so if they'll approach their training with more of the steady state cycle in mind, they're going to one, once they finish the cycle, they're going to have a big jump in strength and two, tremendous longevity. And that's the tremendous longevity. The beauty of body weight strength training is how well-rounded you are. You get the strength, the relative strength, which then translates to absolute strength. Doesn't work vice versa. You can't just be doing bench press than expect to translate to planche pushups. You get the range of motion. You get the body control. You get the, it's just from my research over time, I enjoy all forms of fitness and sports. I can appreciate athletics to the highest level. I like lifting. But there's just something about body weight. I like lifting. We can go into, you know, which exercises I like in that. But consider the difference between how much of your body you use during planche pushups or a regular pushup for that matter, compared to a bench press, you know, just, just scapular mobility alone, you know, where I'm trapped. I can't move shoulder. Can't move lats are trying to contribute, you know, but can't compared to pushup core is locked, posterior pelvic tilt, everything's in place coming down. I mean, there is just a more natural expression of how the body moves. Just, it seems to be, it's the complementary nature of bent and straight arm exercises from the calisthenics. Without question. Without question. So CrossFit, Greg did a tremendous disservice to people's progress in terms of gymnastic strength because it's complicated. And so what they did is they just called it skill training, a planche is not a skill. A planche requires an extreme degree of physical preparation. A backflip is a skill. A cartwheel is a skill. A giant on high bar is a skill. Sprinting, you know, I mean, those are skills. But this other, you know, a muscle-up is not a skill. It's an exercise, right? And it needs to be trained as such. But they couldn't quantify it, so they just kind of threw everything into a box and called it, let's do 10 minutes of skill training at the end. CrossFit used to be, before there were affiliates, it used to be the CrossFit website, and they would post the workout of the day. And it was just always random. And it was originally intended to be one-third sprinting, one-third gymnastics, one-third weightlifting. So if you're a strength athlete, the endurance is going to crush you. If you're an endurance athlete, the strength component is going to crush you. So no matter who you are, right, it's going to spank you. And it's wonderful marketing. Greg, you know, what the F? He had one where they were doing lunges, 400-meter lunges around the track. And I forget how every couple of lunges and overhead press. And the men had one weight and the women had one weight. I was like, well, that's an awesome workout. But why? Because a lot of CrossFitters were never high-end athletes, right? They weren't necessarily national team athletes. They probably weren't college athletes. They might have done a bit of high school athletics. And now suddenly, I get a chance to compete with other people around me. And I could be a stud where I'd never had a chance to be a stud before. And it morphed CrossFit into becoming a lot of conditioning work. And that went fine for a good while until someone, as they should have, wanted to see how to make the system better. The supposition of CrossFit was, you don't have to train these specialties in order to be good at these specialties. So Greg would tell people, you're only going to deadlift twice a year, and you're going to have a 750-pound deadlift. He told people this. And anyone who's going to straighten those, you know, that's nonsense. It's not going to happen. But there are Olympic lifting coaches around who can teach them some mobility specific for Olympic lifting for snatch. We're going to do hip, we're going to knee, we're going to do your Achilles, we're going to work on ankle flexion, we're going to do technical work. And so those people stopped doing the posted wads and started doing real Olympic lifting, the training for it. And they were coming in and crushing the other people. And the CrossFitters didn't realize that CrossFit was now no longer what Greg had said it was, that I can just do these random things and I'll be okay. Suddenly, I have to do a lot of specialist workouts. That's why you see these CrossFitters doing so much training in a day. They're trying to prepare so many different modalities. And they got good enough that they had Olympic lifters, you know, who were qualifying for nationals for national chance and they weren't winning. But from scratch to making nationals is a big deal. Despite the criticisms of CrossFit, it opened people's eyes to the world of Olympic lifting, to the world of gymnastic strength. Because for myself, CrossFit was getting popular around that 2010 period. And I saw people doing ring muscle ups. I thought, oh, that's really cool. And then I dived deeper into the specific world of gymnastic strength because I didn't want to do muscle ups, then also do a snatch and then box jumps, each to their own. But if you want to specialize, you've got to dedicate yourself to it. And I just had a debate two days ago with a CrossFitter. I don't understand the flaw in their reasoning that they'll be so meticulous in their Olympic lifting preparation. And then completely unstructured in terms of their gymnastics preparation. Now I'm just going to get up and swing around and no shoulder prep, no joint prep, no, not going to try to make my handstand better. What is it? Nope, no progressions. They're still doing kipping headstand pushups against a wall as I, but you are so meticulous in your lifting. I don't, I don't understand why you, you, you obviously have already learned to focus. You understand progression. You understand self-discipline. Why can't you take that same lens and focus it over here as well? I don't, I don't believe that there are niches in life, if you will. I don't believe that this part of my life is my working out. This part of my life is my family. This part of my life are my hobbies. These are my friends. This is my professional life. Now I don't, I don't believe in that at all. I don't believe that there's all these separate skill sets. I didn't start being successful in life until I realized there aren't niches. There's just life. And if I approach one thing well, I have the potential to approach everything well, have to remind myself all the time. Still all the people, the flip side applies also. If I'm doing one thing badly, haphazardly, this may start bleeding over into other areas that I don't want that to happen. So, you know, to me, it's, it's, it's one life. Now, you know, you pick your battles, you know, I'm not, I'm not telling people to, uh, you know, be obsessive about everything you do, but pick what's most important to you and do it well. But if you approach gymnastic strength with that mindset, what's going to happen? You're, you remember when I first released Jefferson curl, they were all losing their mind. They were a game changer, especially the way that you were teaching it looked even more aggressive. So you'd have a, a weight held underneath a bench and you extend up into it. That was the squat pikes. That was the squat pikes. Yeah. Two things to fix hamstring is going to be people don't like it because it's, it's not sexy. Standing leg kicks is probably the number one thing to improve hamstring flexibility. It's interesting because you're getting some, uh, it's like inhibition from the contraction of the quads as well to relax the hamstrings. I don't know why. Now the Jefferson curl works, but it's slow process. But if you take that weighted squat on those squat pikes on the bench, start from the squat and then just don't be in a hurry. Just build that pike from the squat. So it's, it's notice it's immediately into the hamstring, especially that upper hamstring where it goes in the glute, right? Where it's, it's a bit sensitive. So that's what the Nordic curls are good for going to that hamstring insertion. There's a guy, he makes his living going around to train, uh, NFL, the American football teams, how to not get hamstring pulled. He's a medical doctor. They think he's a genius. All he's doing is Nordic curls. Yeah. It's a, it's very sports specific because those injuries are happening at length and the Nordic replicates the demands, the eccentric lengthening. Right where that sprint goes into the blue, right? Then nothing else quite, quite gets it. I used to love and have, have, I'm getting ready to get rid of it, uh, a Nautilus pullover. The biggest problem was that the bent elbow took the long head of the tricep out, which led to an imbalance in the back of my shoulder. So I'm, I'm happy as a, as a, as a bug in a rug, do it. Yeah. I'm doing my 170 life is good. It feels easy. Got up to build that. And then it's like, son of a bitch. I should have been doing this with straight arms. But again, it was that I was using a position that allowed maximum leverage, but in order to get that maximum leverage, I had to compromise on the shoulder extension. In gymnastics, we're doing all the straight arm pullovers, like front lever pulls, 360 pulls, whatever, straight arms. Is there merit in replicating it exactly like with a, you know, on a cable machine, having your arms straight doing that versus the bent arm pullover? I think the better one is I can't quite feel scapular elevation with that. So I find if I'm, if I'm supine, if I lay on my, my back on the ground and it's going to drop your weights to nothing, right? It's going to drop the weights to nothing. So I, I literally went now, of course I have injury right now. I'm coming through, but from 170 pounds to five or 10, because it was going from bent arm to straight arm to straight and then doing the extension and then lowering back. Now I'm now granted, I'm using a really slow eccentric followed by an isometric pause, right? But it just, it's just crawling through. You can feel it all through this gaps, through the traps, can feel it through that insertion of the long head of the tricep and it's baby weights, it's baby weights. But I come out of there going, wow, I just got beat up. What the heck is this? Yeah. And so that's more relevant to what we're doing with say handstands replicates the position, bottom of a pull up. Well, I think, I think it's, it's more relevant to that. But I think what it's also doing because it's the disadvantaged position, it's, it's allowing us to dig into the weak links of the structure. There's always going to be the weak link in the chain that breaks. So when my shoulder got hurt, it wasn't the prime movers that got injured, right? My lats were huge from it. My lats were huge. It was that insertion in the back of the shoulder and I was getting biceps tendonitis. Now, why would I get biceps tendonitis from doing body weight overhead work? And then that, that long head of the bicep was, was just getting tendonitis because it, it wasn't getting enough blood flow and it wasn't getting enough direct work to stay healthy. I had cut it out of the circuit, if you will. And so it was atrophying and it was getting weaker and the stronger I was getting here because I'm happy, right? Oh, finally, I'm back to body weight. I'm, I'm on my way to body weight and a half. Life is good. Yes. And that bicep tendon's going, no, we're not, we're not happy here. But all I had to do was put some, some very gentle straight arm work in and that bicep tendon said, thank you. I love you. Seven immediately 70% reduction in pain range of motion. You wouldn't have got that if you kept doing your compounds through pulling, pushing, horizontal, vertical, you wouldn't have got it. Well, and the exciting thing to me, because I was sitting there, I'm 61 now. And before the straight arm work was always characterized as gymnastics specific, not necessarily an athletic benefit or a physical therapy benefit, you know, health and longevity. But now that straight arm work scale. Now, if you jump right into an iron cross, you're screwed. But if we, if we regress it properly, as far down as it needs to go, now that makes the straight arm work tremendously valuable for supporting that other maximal strength work. It's no longer gymnastic specific. This is just athletics. No, no, no, no. And it highlights the importance of doing all of those straight arm basics, your skin, the cats, gym hangs, your back levers, your handstands. There's a guy who just, uh, won Olympic gold in swimming. We've had several swimmers. This isn't mine, but his work here in the 50 meter free is all GST. It's that straight arm work, which is what, this is what happens in athletics. I'm throwing, catching, I'm going through full extension. That, that, it never gets trained in traditional conditioning because it's all bent arm work. No, no, no. We've got to say again, that straight arm is really just a vessel for working the scapula. Yes. It challenges the scapula in such a unique way because when you bend the arms, involves the scapula, but it's not as focused to that region of elevation, depression, retraction. That's an excellent point. That's an excellent point because I was doing those supine pullovers with the straight bar. I could feel the scapula just gliding along the rib cage. You could, you could feel it very clearly, which I've, you try to do it. You know, if I'm doing just shrugs for warming up on stuff, you're doing your hanging shrugs and that kind of, you know, you can feel, you can feel it pulled down, but it nothing near the free full motion of that supine pullover, not even close. It's like, ah, okay, this, this is a keeper. This is because, you know, it's, it's gotta be results based. If it, if it doesn't work demonstrably improve, it's gotta go. And that's where it's, it has that transfer building your straight arm scapular strength. It's no surprise why your bent arm strength skyrockets as a byproduct of that. And to my mind, why would I bullshit you? It makes no sense. I'm simply telling you training. It was that it was all that plyometric work. I started off with 250 undead and never touched. So I went to double body weight. I would just medium strong as a gymnast. I'm not surprised to hear, uh, coach that the plyometric base serves you so well for transfer to weightlifting performance. Because you think about it, you're doing vertical jumps, you're doing standing broad jumps horizontally. When you break down a deadlift, it's a vertical jump in essence in how the hips, knees, triple extension happens. You're doing that in plyometrics. Yes. With your body weight. Deadlift is just, it's more of the musculature, right? They're going to say connective tissue, but connective tissue's job is to rebound force. The real world, if we're not in the civilized world, if we're out having to survive, doing our thing, climbing, falling, running, getting attacked, falling down, getting thrown, the world is a ballistic environment. And we have to absorb and we have to produce ballistic force. There's not a woolly mammoth, right? Who's going to stand still and let me butcher them. Yeah. It's safe to say in that setting, you're, you're not doing things slow, paused and controlled. You're aggressive, plyometric. And same thing goes when you would have had gymnasts putting up these double body weight deadlifts without even doing them. They would, I imagine, approach the bar, grip and rip as explosively as they can. Yeah. No technique. We, we quit Olympic lifting for that reason. We had a limb, because you know, Olympic lifting was, was offered as the be all end all, right? You're going to be fast. You're going to be mobile. You're going to be explosive. You're going to be strong. It's not the case. My, my guy, we spent a long time. I spent a lot of staff. We worked with Russian, great coaches, the great Chinese coaches. We spent a number of years on it and then walked away going, it's too little return for investment. It doesn't make any sense because they, they take my guys. I bring a coach in and they're jerking body weight immediately. What's the point of this? And then I have to do specialized mobility for an overhead squat that I'm never going to use. The rack position. Except for overhead squat. I'm never going to use a rack position except for the rack. So I was like, they're already pulling double and triple body weight. So I don't, I don't think this is the solution. But at the end of the day, I was like, no, there's, there's more effective choices. Uh, so would you say the weightlifting compounds and isolations would have to play more of a role in a, a, a, a, a supplemental because just, I had all that strength from not lifting. I didn't have to lift to be strong. Thinking then was you do gymnastics to get strong in gymnastics. And the guys who were natural mesomorphs, right? They got built, but the guys who were thinner weren't getting a nice hypertrophy work to build muscle. Yeah. Yeah. Cause there's something to be said about the efficiency, calculatedness and simplicity of lifting weights to build muscle. You can of course do this with body weight exercises, but as a compliment. You need, you need those sets. You need those reps. One of the reasons that Simone Biles is so good is she's just so long. We're at national championships. We're in the training gym. Simone hasn't done a thing yet, but she goes walking by and, uh, she's just this little pocket rocket. I don't know, four, six, four, eight, something soldiers like this, just ripped abs, just ripped. And I told Alan, I said, if you marry that girl, the genetics. Oh my God. I will come out of retirement to train your kids. I, I will. And he just laughed and we went and we didn't know what Simone was going to go on and do, but I would just like, oh my God, but she's just her tech. She can, cause her technique when she tumbles is perfect. And so you'll see people who say, well, that's because of all her training. Yes. And no, her, her structure's strong enough. Cause she's completely extended coming into that back handspring thing about just doing a long hollow position. She's doing it under 14 times body weight and holding that while rebounding and snapping. Yeah. It's the combination of her genetically blessed structure of her joints, the ratios of her different limbs in the upper and lower body, her muscle mass to support that and combining that with the physical preparation, the dedication, the mindset. Wonderful coach. Amy is a, was a wonderful coach and was very calm, very methodical. I was her first coach up through real Amy and, uh, did wonderful. It's one thing to do high performance in training. It's another thing to do it in competition. How do you instill that focus and just composure? Is it innate? Is it trained? Everything is math. You need this. Everything's broken into training cycles. We're going to do these skills at this age for this four year block. This next four year block. We're going to do this, this four year block. We're going to do this. We need this many reps. For example, if it's a world class skill and I verified this myself, that it takes a thousand good repetitions to master a high level skill, not a thousand repetitions, a thousand good repetitions. So practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice does perfect practice does. I wanted to test this. So my deal with Robbie was all our workouts. It was summer. Our entire workout is going to be based around this one skill. So I forget if it was a three or a four hour workout and we had to make 10 good repetitions of this skill a day and we're going to work our way up to a thousand. So five days a week training, 50 a week, 200 a month should be five months later. Jump to the end of the story. Guys who went to the world championships for the US saw Robbie's pommel horse later. We were just like, that is the finest pommel routine I've ever seen in my life from a 10 year old. Just, they were just freaking out. And what we found was that if he could get them all done in 10 minutes, then we'd go on with our regular workout. If it took four hours to get the 10 and took four hours, you know, joint joints allowing it, you know, if his risk could take that much, never really took, but we never counted how many missed. Now this also doesn't work unless someone, and we'll come around how we develop it. Someone has to have, so I call it world-class talent married to a blue collar work ethic. You know, a blue collar guy, he's just going to get in. He's going to grind, right? He's going to grind. He's not trying to be fancy or complex or refined. He's just, he's just going to gut it out. And so Robbie, he would take a turn on horse. And you know, when you miss on horse, imagine someone hitting your shins with a broomstick. So you're swinging and you're not just getting hit this way. It's, it's notching. And it, it stings, it stings. And so you jump down, you go, okay, well, I did it the one I'm good. But now you're going up again and it happens again. And it happens again. Well, my older athletes would look at Robbie and go, you know, or he'd go sometimes and he would mess up on the first one and he would hit himself in the groin. And he's luckily he's 10. So, you know, it's not as painful, but it still hurts. Even though he's that he's down on the ground. Oh, and then he'd get up and we'll be crying, chalking up to do his next turn. And my older athletes who were very good at the time, but they weren't Robbie's dedication or like, what? I don't understand coach. And I said, well, how do you beat someone like Robbie? And I said, I'll save you. I'll save you the hassle, gentlemen. You can't. An athlete like Robbie needs someone like me to calm him down. That's enough, dude. You've done enough. Or the other athletes, you're kicking them in the butt. Work harder, work harder. Robbie was what I say is you can't, you can't fake it. You can't fake it. Competence builds confidence. And then when you're out there, when the performance comes, when others that haven't done the work, haven't done the thousands and thousands of perfect reps, of course, they're going to get anxious because they don't have that self belief. Whereas if you've done the work, then you're more inclined to fall into that automatic process of success. Nice way to say it, to just kind of quantify it. Repetition builds consistency. Consistency builds confidence. Confidence is what allows high level performance. And so we get people, they haven't done the repetitions, the good repetitions. So they haven't developed the consistency. So they're not confident. So they can't go out and achieve a world class performance, unless they're lucky. And it happens sometimes. It happens. You can roll the dice and you can win sometimes, but you can't win every time. Because what we want, when they go out on the competition floor, I have no interest in them doing what they're capable of at 100%. I want them to be so over-prepared and so much stronger, and so technically advanced, that their routines are built, they can win with only 70% of their skill set. I can't hit 100% every day. But I can hit 70% day in and day out. Once in a while I'll have a miss, but I can be clockwork. I can be clockwork at 70. But I can't do my best 100% day in day out. Can't be done. That's crazy how hard you have to work to get to that level though. Because just getting to that 70% is high performance, but going above and beyond in training must just be such dedication. So I have, I haven't looked at them in forever, but in here, in this iPad, I'll be able to pull up training days because I'm not interested in the day, I'm interested in the week overall. And I'm interested in how that week goes into the month. Because you have good days, you have bad days, you can't get too bent about the day. But you can get bent about a week. So what the Russians, they had these same records. So they went back and they looked at Olga and she had a 98% hit rate. 98%. Well, what? That's unbelievable. How could she go to the Olympics and fall apart? So they look at it and they finally figure out it was the mental preparation. So she was treated as a princess. She got to warm up as much as she wanted to warm up. When it was time for an evaluation routine, the judges waited on Olga. That's not how the Olympics are. It's not how world championships are. They don't give a shit about you as an athlete. They don't give a shit. You're going to warm up in the back in a separate gym. And at the time they weren't allowing one touches. Now they allow one touches because people were getting seriously hurt. Right? But you, before you weren't even allowed to touch the equipment. So you were in another gym and then you walked down a hallway, which more often than not was just concrete until they call your turn and you go in cold and you do a routine and you've got 30 seconds. After they tell you it's your turn, you've got 30 seconds to be on the equipment. Training for a competitive athlete has to be mentally and physically much harder than competition. Competition needs to be an easy day. It's gotta be an easy day. So you, you play games with them constantly. We're today, we're going to do two routines in a row, one minute in between or get ready for a routine. Walk away and leave them standing there for 10 minutes. It's that comfort of unfamiliarity or novelty of timing circumstances. Just you've got to, you've, stress has. So stress has to become the norm, not in a mean way, not in a harsh way, not in a grading way. But when you're competing at that level, it's like wearing, it's like wearing a concrete vest. That's just squeezing you in and you're, you have trouble breathing. It's that whole you stress versus distress. So the athletes that were prepared for novelty, different circumstances, they still got anxious. They still felt the cortisol and the stress, but it was you stress. It was, it was serving them. They understood what it was for. It's home. Whereas the athletes that didn't, distress, stress, anxiety, stress is a good thing, right? Stress makes you focus fresh gives that little spike of adrenaline. Stress makes you sharp, right? Stress is a wonderful thing used appropriately stress and too much dosage, right? Destroys the organism physically and mentally. So we're teaching them methodically to thrive in a stressful environment. And the psychology of women in competition is very different than the psychology of men. They need even more stress than a man needs. So we can go over why if you like, but it's, it's a very different. Why is that? So if you go to compete or I go to compete and we're men, we're focused on one thing. We're going to win. We literally don't give a shit about anything else or anyone else. We're, we're a hundred percent focused. It's hardwired into us as men, right? We're there to get shit done. That is not the psychology of women. She goes out to compete. She wants to win, but there's a lot of things in front of that emotionally for a woman. She's worried about the people around her. Are they going to do well? As guys, we don't give a shit what our, if our competition's going to do well, I hope the son of a bitch screws up, right? They're not like that there. I hope everyone does well at the same time. Remember women are catty. So they're worried about, are they going to like me? Does everyone like me here? The meat hasn't even started. They're worrying about someone else. They're worrying about, does everyone like me? Then they're worried about, am I going to let my coach down? Am I going to let my teammates down? Am I going to let the parents down? They have all our social media in the mix, the public perception, the sponsors, because women are supposed in a relationship or nurturing. So all of these things that make competition so much harder for them in the real world environment are tremendously valuable. But when they're going out to compete, they have all these other emotional circuits that we as men don't have. I've watched women in training doing their beam routine, which is four inches wide, solid as a rock, like they were on a three foot wide sidewalk. Just not a twitch, not a quiver, like, holy shit, are you kidding me? And then the meat will start and it'll look like they'd never been on beam in their entire life. Even the girls themselves know. When I started training the girls, a girl started crying during Hungarian. Well, if a guy cries, he's hurt, right? If he's crying a lot, there's a bone sticking out of his leg somewhere. I'm like, well, I got to stop. And the other girls are like, well, just ignore her. She does that. Girls do that. I'm like, things would be different in the landscape of modern gymnastics where teams would have access to sports psychologists. And I'm sure that they would be teaching men these tactics as well as women about how to stay focused and maybe tolerate against their natural programming. Simone struggled a lot until Amy took her to a sports psychologist. If you have a psychologist who really understands competition and all around the perimeter of the gym were these three by five signs of yes. Yes. There is yeses everywhere. Yes, you can. Yes, it'll be okay. Yes, it'll be great. Kumbaya. And everyone's a winner. Everyone's a winner. And then she gets to the meat and there is no yes. It's just that crushing pressure we talked about because they hadn't prepared her for it, right? Could she have made team? I don't think she would have, but she would have definitely been better than night. It'd have been very close, but not quite herself because of just all this silly fairy tale nonsense of it'll be okay. No, it's not going to be okay. It's not going to be okay. It's going to be brutal. I'm sorry it's brutal, but this is the price of admission. When they're training with me, we don't do it right next turn. We do it right this turn. However close you can come to it this turn. If that takes one turn, seven turn, ten turns, it doesn't matter, right? Because I mentally, I want you zoned in. I want you zoned in. Tomorrow doesn't matter. Next turn doesn't matter. This turn matters. I do have issues with the new climate today where everything is lovely and rainbows and unicorns. The idea of everyone is getting a participation award, everyone gets a medal. I don't believe in those. It really instills a lack of desire to progress to your full potential. Well, if I can win and it took no effort and the winner who worked twice as hard as me got exactly what I got, well, I'd be kind of stupid to work as hard as him when I got what he got anyway and I didn't do anything. But it's not real. Yeah, but it works in all aspects of life because you wouldn't look at social friendships as a competitive thing. But if you're not putting in effort into a friendship and someone else is putting in more, they're going to want to hang out with that person. Then you get into the business world, the one that learns more, applies, will earn more money and go up in that domain. So as I can see where we're coming from with participation to create this I think it's a terrible thing. Somewhat of a healthier environment. It's not healthier. It's fake. It doesn't work in practice. Yeah. Make them. It doesn't work in practice. Let them fail. We give medals out to third place. And I think they're really depriving these kids, you know, where let them fail. I want to be a great athlete. Fail, fail, fail. And then I've worked my ass off and I suck as an athlete. Awesome. Okay. Now we know you're not going to be an athlete. What are you good at? Maybe it's literature. Maybe it's academics. Maybe I'm a good artist. Maybe a musician. It doesn't matter. But I have to go and fail in all these areas till I find where my talents are. Because that's why you do body weight, right? Your phenotype, everything allows you to have success in this area. You're not, you didn't pursue sumo wrestling. Right? You're not built for it. It wouldn't make any sense. Right? Or someone who's 6'6\". The easy wind is, and I've had great guys at 6'6 and GST, but the smart money is go be a basketball player. Right? Height is at a premium. In the United States, 10%. Think about this. 10% of the people who are seven feet tall in the United States are in the NBA. It's this combining your passion with what you're actually genetically predisposed to having success at. That's the way you get harmony of fulfillment and material success. There was a German coach who went down to your neck of the woods. And one of the East German rowing coaches moved to Australia. And he runs a nationwide tryout. He doesn't care if the girls, he teaches women. He doesn't care if the women have ever rode before. All he's testing for is VO2 max. Chinese are big on this too. He's checking limb lengths. He wants a particular length of thigh and a particular length of upper arm. His particular torso. He wants everything in a very particular way. Well, he picked women who were genetically suited to be rowers. He liked their attitude. He's a world-class coach. Three years later, they were world champs. Because if you've got the base of those genetics, you've got the attributes that are suited to the sport. VO2 max, wattage and power. You can learn the mechanical skill afterwards. And you're learning so much faster. If you've got perfect mechanical skill, but you don't have the raw horsepower, you won't be able to compete. And that's what I think this soft approach in sports and academics is. It's not allowing the kids to fail so they don't have an opportunity to find out what they're good at. I have noticed something about people who are destined for success. Someone will see. I've noticed there's basically two ways for someone who's on the outside to look at someone who's successful. That's awesome. I want to learn how to do this. Please teach me. There there wasn't a jealousy component. I looked at it as, thank God they know how to do it. They can teach me. You know, my mentors who taught me about business. You know, it wasn't about, well, no, you're not. But the knee jerk reaction for far too many people is the denial, the belittling, the, the jealousy. Well, they don't deserve it. They had this, they had that. It should have been me instead of, how do I do it? I'm bright. I'm capable. I just don't know how. Well, coach, that was really well said how you interlaced the training with the carryover to life. And that's something that I'm really glad that I picked up at a young age, working out at 17, being a shy introverted kid, learning that, you know, if I can improve in one domain, you can translate that to other things. So then starting to do personal training, getting comfortable talking one on one to a variety of different people, then translating that onto a camera, speaking at first to 100 people, then eventually thousands, 10,000, 100,000. And then just over time, just iterative, small progress. It's not as if you're going to wake up one day, be big, strong, same thing for whatever you're trying to improve in life. And then, yeah, I just pinch myself at what I've been able to progress towards in terms of like doing workshops in front of 50 people and talking. So not saying this to toot my own horn, more just to give everyone listening that. Yeah, exactly. It's not, it's, if it's real, it's, it's not that it's tooting a horn. That's, that's that constant process of refinement. You know, as we've been here, okay, what's next? It's the steady state. I've done this for 12 weeks. What's next? My business has been at this point for a while. What's next? My physique has been here for a while. What's next? My skill's been here for a while. It's all a working process. On behalf of the calisthenics and gymnastics community coach, we appreciate what you did for the culture, bringing out the forums and the gymnastics bodies resources. Where can people follow your work now? Gymnasticbodies.com. Basically, we're going to, we have all of our body weight stuff. And I think, I think it's time to over the next year or so, I'll start making available for our members, the plyometric work, the movement work, the advanced ring strength work. Thanks again for your time, coach. My pleasure, Daniel.\n",

      " How is bodyweight strength training different for adults compared to children? Good question. First seminar I ever did for adults. I'm a national team coach. And what I learned is it really skewed my expectations of what was normal because that was my world. That was who I was surrounded by. They weren't exceptional. They just were. These are the expectations. I ask them to do things and they can perform at this level. So I run an event for adults, first GB seminar on their schedule for the day. And I'm going to take them through just a gentle warmup, nothing hard, nothing demanding. I've got 15 minutes on the schedule, 10 minutes, 15 if we're dragging. I can't get them to focus. They're not paying attention, whatever. And it took an hour and a half for a nothing warmup. They were wrecked from it. They were wrecked. They were exhausted, sweat everywhere, body strewn all over the floor. I remember turning to my staff and I go, you know, what do I do now? You know, they failed warmup. You know, we have to adjust all the rest of the three days on the fly because their level of prep and capacity was so much lower than I expected. What was the warmup out of interest? What did that involve? Nothing. There was no plyometrics in it. There was no advanced mobility. There would have been basic positions, front, left, middle, pancake, shoulder extension, which we know now they didn't have. You know, my guys, we would do our wrist prep series. A lot of the things we would do weren't considered strength. They were considered warmup. So an example would be, we're going to do the wrist series with all the, are my wrist pushup series that everyone now thinks, you know, we've, we've known about this stuff since the beginning of time, but it wasn't, it was my series, but you know, it's maybe 50 different pushups, different variations. It should take my athletes a couple of minutes to get through it. You know, just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, letting them know if you can't handle 50 pushups, even though these are difficult, you know, wrist pushups, if you can't handle that, that an iron cross is out of the question. You know, or, you know, part of, part of their warmup was, um, on a seven meter rope, three rope climbs in a row, climb the rope, three laps in a row without stopping in the back of the line. We run through it three times. That was warmup for us. That's just checking the pressure in the tires. How's the oil today? How do I feel? Okay. After, after that kind, that kind of level work, now we can actually go and start training. So out of, out of all my friends who are, you know, Olympians and world championship coaches and all that stuff, I w I was unusual that they just wanted to work with the best. That's all they wanted to do. And I'd get fussed at all the time. For working with people who weren't just my national team athletes. Unless the Chinese more quiet, my friends who were rushed, we're just like, what are you doing? What are you doing? And I said, well, you know, I like to work with people who give me everything to have. They may not be very good, but I really enjoy that. I'd much, I've, I've thrown Olympians out of the gym because they weren't working hard enough. You know, and people around me were, you know, they're freaking out. They're like, you know, nationals is next week. I don't give a damn. I don't give a damn. This lack of effort is unacceptable. I'm not doing it. Not doing it. But you know, they would have said, well, absolutely. We'll do it. Blah, blah, blah, blah. No. So I have this young man named Tim who's overweight and he comes to a GB seminar, which is sculpted bodies everywhere, muscle everywhere, studs, male, female. They're very athletic. And here's Tim pudgy, overweight, but he's just busting his butt. He's just busting his butt. And I loved it. I just loved it. And, um, I hadn't talked to everyone in the story was he had lost a hundred pounds, but he couldn't train, trained. So just our mobility work had been his workout. That was all he could do. And he used that to lose a hundred pounds. I still, to this day, that's been, I don't know, 15 years ago, 12 years ago. I just, I just love the, the dedication. Cause think how hard it is for someone who's in normal shape to do my material. And here's this guy that, you know, putting on his socks in the morning, wears him out and he's consistent and he's working hard. And it's like, you know, guys, this is, this is what I love right here. Cause we've been for, I've been fortunate enough to, um, I'm sure you have to, I've worked with a lot of people, a lot of different spheres. So, you know, you know, we've had some billionaires, we worked with some bestselling authors, some, you know, the normal, you know, special operations stuff, what they have in common is they all do their best. Whatever, whatever it is, their best ad. It's like, it's like a common language. You know, I'm sure, I'm sure there's guys out there who don't operate that way, but I haven't met them, you know, in those spheres. And so when I see someone who they'll give me their best at me, the quality may not be good, but they're giving me everything. Okay. And this one area, since they've learned that now we can, we can push that out into other areas. And that's refreshing for people to hear that are listening to this because they'll see a champion world-class Olympian in gymnastics, and they see what's required to achieve that level. It's nice to know that if we embody that work ethic, regardless of our point, we'll go on to achieve great things. And that's a universal mindset of people that do make progress. You might. So, Alan, so my last athlete almost made the Olympic team for Tokyo. He was alternate. So we were just a bit short. For those who haven't interacted with world-class athletes, they're not stronger. They're not faster. They're not just more coordinated in a way that you kind of imagine or can grasp. They're so much further ahead physically that they're almost from a different planet. You know, that there's that very top, top group. People who have tried to roll on the mat with Olympic judo players. You know, it's just like they tried to wrestle with a tornado. And one guy, you know, he didn't back off enough and he came out with a broken collarbone. And the other guy was trying to be easy, but the one guy had bit off more than he could chew, right? And he was on the mat with the wrong guy. And so even with that level of talent for Alan, it still took me 12 years and over 16,000 hours of training. As picky as I am and as demanding as I am, it took that, even though he had this tremendous level of talent, right? It still took me thousands and thousands of hours to get him to where I needed him to be. I also had other athletes that worked just as hard as Alan, weren't on national team and didn't win nationals and didn't make a world team and didn't make an Olympic team, but they did, they did a decade of training with me. They kind of think, well, you know, that 10,000 hour rule, if I do everything I should do, I'm going to achieve world-class performance. And the answer is maybe, you know, if, if the potential, so the question is, is it nurture or it's nature? And it's both. I, I can't develop what's not there, but we can try to maximize what you have. That may be a lot more than you expect, right? Might be a lot more than you expect. It may be disappointing, but there's nothing you can do about it either way. This is the hand of cards you've been dealt in life. You know, you don't get to fold and say, well, I'll take another hand, right? This, this is what you got. Do the best with it. And if you're one of the fortunate few, you'll crank. But, you know, if not, you know, I ran my entire gym on best effort, you know, that, that was everything for us, you know? So who gave me best effort, who was living up to their potential? Uh, they were recognized for that. And that guys, even if Alan won nationals, but it wasn't everything that he could have done, right? And if he, so we would, I would line, the reason it matters, I would line all my athletes up according to how they had performed at their competitions, but the scores didn't matter. And the placings didn't matter. It was all about what were you personally capable of best effort on that routine plus a stuck landing, right? And so I'd get little guys who barely could walk in a straight line and I, I'd put them in the front of the line, right? The real, the real world and the listeners are going to know, you know, your, your boss doesn't care if you did your best, if you failed and the company lost a lot of money. He, he doesn't care. He can't afford to care, right? Cause he has expenses, right? He's got overhead. There's paychecks to go out. He needs you to be a stud and he needs you to win. He needs you to produce, but in the gym and I let my athletes know this, you know, I can artificially control this for right now, for now you giving me your best is good enough while letting them know outside in the real world, not only are they not going to care, they can't afford to care. And so, you know, right now we're going to, we're going to train you. So one of my athletes who couldn't eat physically, couldn't hang with Alan, but, uh, some dorky little kid when he was little, this huge pair of ears took, I took three years teaching him a cartwheel. Wow. I used to tease Ian all the time. I was like, dude, I could have taught a little kid in a wheelchair, a cartwheel faster than you've learned this. This is, this is kind of silly, dude, but he just kept the, just give me a big goofy smile and he jumped back in, but he just would never stop. And then every year I would think he was maxed out and he would still improve right when I thought he couldn't do anymore. Now he'd have to work twice as hard as everyone else. And he's, he's a pilot in the air force. He's a major, right? A little guy who wasn't a good student, wasn't a good athlete initially, right? But just kept his nose to the grindstone. And so, you know, will you, will you see someone without massive talent on an Olympic team? You won't, but that's five guys out of 330 million. Given the genetics, uh, elite to start with, and it's coupled with that mindset of pushing yourself hard consistently. In addition to that, your method focuses heavily on physical preparation. Why is this the case? A hundred percent. It was my experiences in training. So I remember national team coach, Olympic training center, sports scientists in and out constantly pressure plates, you know, all the, all the sensors, athletes wired up all the time. And, um, we, we found out that even something as simple as a round off back handspring backflip, you know, that, that punch in the backflip was 14 times body weight. Think about the structural adaptation. So tendons and ligaments strengthen through extremely high loads for a micro fraction of a second. That's, that's how they're conditioned. You know, you for, for athletic purposes, I can get stronger through isometric pause, controlling and eccentric, but that's, that's really a fairly low ceiling for that. But, and notice, notice it's starting to come around now where they're, they're talk. The buzzword right now is the plyometrics, right? We're going to do plyometrics, but it's really, they're all, they're all just doing low end plyometrics. They're doing jumps. You know, there's very little rebound work. There's very little straight leg work. There's zero lock arm work. Years ago, I, uh, was invited by, uh, Paula Quinn to, uh, go to their headquarters in Rhode Island. I believe it was to do a dynamic strength seminar. So basically upper body plyometrics, big, strong guys, monsters everywhere, dwarfed me. And so we go and I spend the whole day doing a physical prep. Now just get them ready. Don't want anyone to get hurt. Act of mobility, you know, how are they? And by then it was, uh, time to just, um, do what I would do with a five-year-old. And we start them with, uh, imagine a, a pushup position with locked elbows and just bouncing up and down in place. No, no bending the knees, no bending the elbows, no sagging the stomach, sheer repulsion strength, rebound strength through the shoulder girdle. None of them, they, they were glued to the floor, you know, and I hadn't trained in forever. And I was like, you know, guys, this is, this is, I brought athletes with me and they're, well, you know, these guys are athletes and guys, I'm a fossil. And I got down and, you know, and showed them to this, this is, this is easy stuff guys, but they had never been exposed to it. And that's, that's kind of where the athleticism comes from. What are the standards you're looking for from a physical prep perspective, like numbers and stuff fucked up? Well, back in the day, Greg Glassman, I was the gymnastics guy for Crossed Head. They wanted people to go into kipping pull-ups, but you know, I said, you know, Greg, you're, the kipping pull-ups are actually kind of the final step, if you will. And you, you guys are doing it first, doing it first. And he's, well, you know, they get excited, you know, and they've never done a\n"

      "\n",
      "- **Expectations & Capacity:** Adults often have lower baseline fitness, mobility, and coordination compared to trained children (e.g., 15-minute warmup became an hour-long ordeal).\n",
      "- **Warmup Focus:** For adults, basic mobility and joint preparation are critical; for kids, advanced movements like rope climbs or complex pushups may be part of the warmup.\n",
      "- **Training Intensity:** Adults need more structured, progressive prep before skill work. Kids often train at higher intensity from the start.\n",
      "- **Mindset & Work Ethic:** Adults may lack the consistent effort seen in children who are eager to learn and improve.\n",
      "- **Physical Adaptation:** Children naturally adapt faster due to flexibility and growth; adults require more deliberate strength and mobility work for similar gains.\n"

      "Bodyweight strength training for adults differs from children in focus, intensity, and expectations. Adults often lack foundational mobility, stability, and coordination, requiring more time on warmups and basic movements. Children, especially elite athletes, are naturally more adaptable and can handle higher-intensity, complex routines with less preparation. For adults, the emphasis is on building a strong base through controlled, progressive work, while children can push into advanced skills sooner. Consistency and effort matter more than innate talent for adults, as progress often comes from dedicated, structured training over time.\n",

      "This transcript discusses key principles for effective bodyweight and gymnastics training, emphasizing:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Progression over overload**: Starting with controlled movements (e.g., chin-over-bar pull-ups) before progressing to kipping or weighted work.\n",
      "- **Mobility vs. flexibility**: Mobility is about strength through range of motion, not just flexibility.\n",
      "- **Steady-state training**: Keeping consistent workload for 8–12 weeks builds long-term strength and prevents overtraining.\n",
      "- **Longevity in training**: Overtraining early leads to burnout; steady progress ensures sustainability.\n",
      "- **Balance in training**: A well-rounded program includes strength, mobility, and skill work—no single focus.\n",
      "- **Avoiding ego-driven training**: Focusing on the process rather than quick results or external validation.\n",

      "This transcript discusses **steady state training** as a method for improving performance through **neurological adaptation**, **technique refinement**, and **mental discipline**, rather than just increasing load. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Progressive overload** doesn’t always mean heavier weights; manipulating tempo, intent, and repetition control can improve neuromuscular efficiency.\n",
      "- **Steady state training** has stages: *overload* (challenging), *load* (easier but consistent), and *under load* (boredom phase). Staying in the *load* stage builds resilience and avoids premature progression.\n",
      "- **Injury risk** is high when athletes push too fast; structural weaknesses may not be felt until it's too late.\n",
      "- **Mental discipline** is crucial—staying patient, avoiding impulsive load increases, and focusing on consistency over quick gains.\n",
      "- Example: An athlete doing 135 lbs deadlifts for 2–3 reps for 12 weeks improved significantly when he finally added weight, showing that steady progress yields better results than rushing.\n",
      "- **Eccentrics** help strengthen connective tissue by increasing blood flow and reducing injury risk.\n",
      "- Bodyweight training offers **longevity**, **range of motion**, and **functional strength**—unlike bodybuilding, which relies on sarcoplasmic hypertrophy (fluid retention).\n",
      "- CrossFit’s approach to gymnastics as “skill” oversimplifies the physical preparation required for movements like the planche or muscle-up.\n",
      "- The goal is not just short-term gains but long-term athletic durability and performance.\n",

      "Summary:  \n",
      "CrossFit evolved from general conditioning into more specialized training, leading to the need for focused skill development in areas like Olympic lifting and gymnastics. Specialization requires structured progression, not just random workouts. Gymnastic strength benefits from straight-arm movements (like supine pullovers) that target scapular control and weak links, improving overall performance. Plyometrics build explosive power transferable to lifts like deadlifts. Training should be holistic—skills in one area influence others. Focus on quality, progression, and addressing weaknesses for long-term gains.\n",

      "Summary:  \n",
      "The key strategies discussed include:  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Focus on effective movements**: Prioritize weightlifting compounds and isolations as supplements for muscle growth, especially for those not naturally built.  \n",
      "- **Perfect practice over repetition**: Mastery comes from 1,000 quality reps, not just quantity.  \n",
      "- **Consistency builds confidence**: Repetition leads to reliability, which is essential for high-level performance.  \n",
      "- **Mental preparation is critical**: Training must simulate competition stress to build resilience and focus.  \n",
      "- **Gender differences in competition psychology**: Women face more emotional distractions; mental training is vital.  \n",
      "- **Preparation vs. competition**: Competition should feel easy — train with stress to make it routine.  \n",
      "- **Role of sports psychologists**: Help athletes manage pressure, especially for women who face unique emotional challenges.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Training should be done \"this turn,\" not deferred.  \n",
      "- A \"participation award\" mentality hinders growth by reducing motivation to improve.  \n",
      "- Failure is necessary to discover one's true potential and strengths.  \n",
      "- Success comes from combining passion with genetic predisposition.  \n",
      "- Coaches like the East German rowing coach focus on natural ability (e.g., VO2 max, limb length) before skill development.  \n",
      "- Successful people often look at others' achievements with curiosity, not jealousy.  \n",
      "- Progress in one area (like fitness) can translate to other life skills (communication, confidence).  \n",

Adults often lack foundational mobility, stability, and coordination, requiring more time on warmups and basic movements. Children, especially elite athletes, are naturally more adaptable and can handle higher-intensity, complex routines with less preparation. For adults, the emphasis is on building a strong base through controlled, progressive work, while children can push into advanced skills sooner. Consistency and effort matter more than innate talent for adults, as progress often comes from dedicated, structured training over time.']}\n"

Key points include:\\n\\n- **Progressive overload** doesn’t always mean heavier weights; manipulating tempo, intent, and repetition control can improve neuromuscular efficiency.\\n- **Steady state training** has stages: *overload* (challenging), *load* (easier but consistent), and *under load* (boredom phase). Staying in the *load* stage builds resilience and avoids premature progression.\\n- **Injury risk** is high when athletes push too fast; structural weaknesses may not be felt until it's too late.\\n- **Mental discipline** is crucial—staying patient, avoiding impulsive load increases, and focusing on consistency over quick gains.\\n- Example: An athlete doing 135 lbs deadlifts for 2–3 reps for 12 weeks improved significantly when he finally added weight, showing that steady progress yields better results than rushing.\\n- **Eccentrics** help strengthen connective tissue by increasing blood flow and reducing injury risk.\\n- Bodyweight training offers **longevity**, **range of motion**, and **functional strength**—unlike bodybuilding, which relies on sarcoplasmic hypertrophy (fluid retention).\\n- CrossFit’s approach to gymnastics as “skill” oversimplifies the physical preparation required for movements like the planche or muscle-up.\\n- The goal is not just short-term gains but long-term athletic durability and performance.\"]}\n",

Specialization requires structured progression, not just random workouts. Gymnastic strength benefits from straight-arm movements (like supine pullovers) that target scapular control and weak links, improving overall performance. Plyometrics build explosive power transferable to lifts like deadlifts. Training should be holistic—skills in one area influence others.

I want to shoot in a freezing Canadian forest while being chased around by a guy whose head looks like a genital wart. It is an honor being a part of these huge franchises like Game of Thrones and Star Wars, but I'm still getting used to people recognizing me. The other day, a guy stopped me on the street and said, my son loves the Mandalorian. And the next thing I know, I'm face timing with a six-year-old who has no idea who I am because my character wears a mask for the entire show. So the guy's like, just do the Mando voice. But the Mando voice is like a bedroom voice. Without the mask, it just sounds porny. So people walking by on the street just see me whispering to a six-year-old kid. I can bring you in warm, or I can bring you in cold. Even though I'm in the cold, I'm still in the cold. I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the cold, but I'm still in the warm, or I can bring you in cold. Even though I came to the U.S. when I was little, I was born in Chile. And I have 34 first cousins who are still there. They're very proud of me. I know they're proud because they give my phone number to every single person on me. Which means every day someone in Santiago will text me stuff like, can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come to my wedding, or can you come Which means every day someone in Santiago will text me stuff like, can you come to my wedding or can you sing my priest happy birthday? Or is baby Yoda mean in real life? So I have to be like, no, no. And his name is Grogu. My cousins were always so proud. Early in my career, I played small parts in every crime show. And I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that.

I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be, is called Range. But it is amazing to be here. Like I said, I was born in Chile, and nine months later, my parents fled Pinochet and brought me and my sister to the U.S. They were so brave. And without them, I wouldn't be here in this wonderful country. And I certainly wouldn't be standing here with you all tonight. So to all my family watching in Chile, I just want to say Te amo, te extraño, y deja de dejar de that, mi información personal, which means I love you, I miss you, and stop giving out my phone number. We've got an amazing show for you tonight. Old ladies here, so let's kick around. We'll be right back.\")"

       "Document(metadata={'source': 'NyjXMMBPvSA'}, page_content=\"[Musica] Ciao ragazzi, benvenuti sul mio canale YouTube e sulla mia pagina Facebook. Oggi sono qua per parlarvi delle trazioni e in particolare vi voglio parlare di quello che secondo me è il problema più grosso delle trazioni che ho riscontrato finora. Questo perché la trazione è un movimento che parte da completa estensione degli atti superiori e poi prevede di portare il mento sopra. Poi eh le regole moderne dello street lifting che a me personalmente fanno cagare, prevede che si vada in questa posizione qua e sia sufficiente fare così. Purtroppo questo, secondo me, non è un movimento e un'esecuzione che riflette una persona forte. È più probabile, secondo me, che rifletta una persona che è molto esplosiva, cioè che riesce ad accelerare molto, perché la qualità, la capacità di grindare viene solo se voi andate col mento sopra e tenete la posizione. Questo è il mio punto di vista. Poi c'è la final rap. Le regole le decidono loro. A me personalmente fanno cagare. Non ho un problema a dirlielo. Lo dico un'altra volta, mi fanno cagare. Ok, detto questo, parliamo dell'attrazione e uno dei problemi più grossi. Prima di continuare con il bellissimo argomento di questo video, voglio invitarti ad attivare la campanellina, a lasciare un commento, lasciare un like. Solo così potete aiutarmi a far crescere questo canale che è sempre stato gratuito e che ho sempre voluto coltivare con la mia passione. L'aumento dei delle visualizzazioni, l'aumento degli iscritti, quanto può diffondere questo canale, è solo merito vostro. Oltre a questo, vi invito a seguirmi sul mio canale Instagram dove condivido i risultati dei miei allievi perché io ci tengo ad essere conosciuto per i risultati dei miei allievi e sono importantissime e sotto questi video vado a condividere anche molti tips e molti suggerimenti. Visitate il mio sito dove ci sono articoli gratuiti, le demo dei miei video corsi che poi se vi piacciono potete anche acquistare e dopo dal menù contattami potete anche ricevere tutte le informazioni sui prezzi e le modalità per farvi seguire da me. Io seguo chi vuole imparare. Oggi parliamo del problema più grosso delle trazioni. Allora, siccome non tutte le persone sono uguali, ci sono quelle che hanno delle proporzioni corporee. C'è chi più grande di qua, più spesso di là, più eccetera eccetera. Uno dei problemi principali, secondo me, il più grosso è quando la persona ha le braccia lunghe e deve fare una valanga di strada per arrivare su. Non solo, ma il problema più grosso è quando nella lunghezza completa dell'alta superiore abbiamo una lunghezza dell'avambraccio che è più lunga rispetto al braccio. Questo che cosa comporta? Questo comporta che nel momento in cui la persona esegue la chiusura, l'omero che è corto è già arrivato qua, l'avambraccio è ancora là sopra, quindi la persona dovrà produrre molta più estensione dell'omero per riuscire a portare la sbarra in basso. Ora, se vi capita questa persona, voi che cosa potete fare? Beh, avete due principali opzioni. Una, allargare la presa. Sapendo benissimo che lavorerete poco con i fasili longitudinali del dorso, andrete a lavorare molto di più, per esempio, con i rotondi e sicuramente avete meno ROM, però non potete sfruttare bicipite, oppure due, andate ad utilizzare una presa supina semplicemente perché la suplinazione vi rende più facile questa tipologia di chiusura. Un'altra cosa che poi voi potete fare è che, ragazzi, dovete insistere sulla tirata orizzontale perché se voi quando l'omero arriva qua non siete bravi a strizzare quest'ultimo grado che è quello che succede nel tirato orizzontale, nel pullley, voi non potete sperare di migliorare nell'ultima parte. Quindi la vera combinazione è cambiare qualcosa nella presa che può facilitare la chiusura, come per esempio la supina, oppure allargare la presa che riduce la strada. Però lì non utilizzerete molti bicipiti, utilizzerete di meno dorsale, principalmente i fasci trasversali del dorsale. E poi sicuramente una cosa che non deva mai mancare, dovete fare lavoro di tirata orizzontale. Tutto qua. Ciao ragazzi, ci vediamo al prossimo\")"
