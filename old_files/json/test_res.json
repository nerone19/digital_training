      " Ring push-ups are better than floor push-ups for a few reasons. The increased range of motion is where the magic lies. The latest science on bodybuilding shows that an emphasis on the stretch is really important for getting best results. Rings apply the science in practice. Your chest is going to get really sore after a workout, which is a good proxy for growth. Once again, rings feel better on your body. Because of that freedom of movement, you can use a technique that suits your body type, including your flexibility, your limb lengths, your strengths. It's all going to change the way your push-up looks. Contrast this with floor push-ups where your hands are fixed and your body's forced into this rigid technique. No one tells you how to exercise, not even the floor."

      "Ring push-ups offer a greater range of motion, enhancing muscle stretch for better growth. They allow for personalized movement based on individual flexibility and body type, unlike fixed-floor push-ups. Ring workouts feel more natural and can lead to greater soreness, indicating effective training."

      " The most popular workout splits for calisthenics include full body, working every muscle from head to toe in each workout that you do. Upper lower, simply spreading your workouts to a dedicated upper day and a leg day. Bent arm straight arm, this is a calisthenics focused split which improves your straight arm scapular strength for things like front levers and planches. Push pull legs, this is a classic split for people who want a dedicated focus on their upper body. Workout splits are laid to structure your week so that you can fit in all of those calisthenics exercises that you want to do, such as muscle-ups, handstands, push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and much more. In practice, this means you'll be working out around three to five days per week with around 24 to 48 hours between workouts using the same muscles and movements. We need a smart structure so we can apply progressive overload to avoid injury and overtraining. What workout split are you currently following? Drop a comment and have a chat with the bros."
