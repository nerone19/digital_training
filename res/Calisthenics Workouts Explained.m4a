 The most popular workout splits for calisthenics include full body, working every muscle from head to toe in each workout that you do. Upper lower, simply spreading your workouts to a dedicated upper day and a leg day. Bent arm straight arm, this is a calisthenics focused split which improves your straight arm scapular strength for things like front levers and planches. Push pull legs, this is a classic split for people who want a dedicated focus on their upper body. Workout splits are laid to structure your week so that you can fit in all of those calisthenics exercises that you want to do, such as muscle-ups, handstands, push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and much more. In practice, this means you'll be working out around three to five days per week with around 24 to 48 hours between workouts using the same muscles and movements. We need a smart structure so we can apply progressive overload to avoid injury and overtraining. What workout split are you currently following? Drop a comment and have a chat with the bros.
