 Ring push-ups are better than floor push-ups for a few reasons. The increased range of motion is where the magic lies. The latest science on bodybuilding shows that an emphasis on the stretch is really important for getting best results. Rings apply the science in practice. Your chest is going to get really sore after a workout, which is a good proxy for growth. Once again, rings feel better on your body. Because of that freedom of movement, you can use a technique that suits your body type, including your flexibility, your limb lengths, your strengths. It's all going to change the way your push-up looks. Contrast this with floor push-ups where your hands are fixed and your body's forced into this rigid technique. No one tells you how to exercise, not even the floor.
