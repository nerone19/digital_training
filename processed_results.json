      " Ring push-ups are better than floor push-ups for a few reasons. The increased range of motion is where the magic lies. The latest science on bodybuilding shows that an emphasis on the stretch is really important for getting best results. Rings apply the science in practice. Your chest is going to get really sore after a workout, which is a good proxy for growth. Once again, rings feel better on your body. Because of that freedom of movement, you can use a technique that suits your body type, including your flexibility, your limb lengths, your strengths. It's all going to change the way your push-up looks. Contrast this with floor push-ups where your hands are fixed and your body's forced into this rigid technique. No one tells you how to exercise, not even the floor."

      "Ring push-ups offer a greater range of motion, enhancing muscle stretch and growth. They allow for personalized movement based on individual flexibility and strength, unlike fixed-floor push-ups. This adaptability makes rings more effective and comfortable for varied body types."

      " The most popular workout splits for calisthenics include full body, working every muscle from head to toe in each workout that you do. Upper lower, simply spreading your workouts to a dedicated upper day and a leg day. Bent arm straight arm, this is a calisthenics focused split which improves your straight arm scapular strength for things like front levers and planches. Push pull legs, this is a classic split for people who want a dedicated focus on their upper body. Workout splits are laid to structure your week so that you can fit in all of those calisthenics exercises that you want to do, such as muscle-ups, handstands, push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and much more. In practice, this means you'll be working out around three to five days per week with around 24 to 48 hours between workouts using the same muscles and movements. We need a smart structure so we can apply progressive overload to avoid injury and overtraining. What workout split are you currently following? Drop a comment and have a chat with the bros."

      " yeah right right that was pretty cool clearly the exercise was too challenging of a progression straight away have you ever tried a tucked front lever no when you did it bless your soul you went you went straight into the full thing it's better to do a tuck and then extend out don't go so wide with your hands bring it in closer yep sweet so keep your arms straight knees to chest higher higher higher yep with that i can do that now lower down a little bit a little bit yep keep your heels to your bum try and just flatten your lower back there you go ten nine eight 5, 4, keep going, 3, 2, 1, and relax. I've got to christen the gym with an authentic front lever locked elbow completely. Doing it bent, it's not a front lever anymore. It has to be straight."
